## Overview
This is the accompanying repository for my Medium article:

__[Hands-on Graph Neural Networks with PyTorch & PyTorch Geometric](https://medium.com/@huangkh19951228/hands-on-graph-neural-networks-with-pytorch-pytorch-geometric-359487e221a8)__.

You will learn:
* how to implement custom Graph Convolutional layer with _MessagePassing_
* how to prepare data for training Graph Neural Networks
* how to build custom Graph Neural Networks

## Files
* __YooChooseClick.ipynb:__ All the code in the blog post lies here.
* __YooChooseBuy.ipynb:__ The code I used to solve the second task of RecSys Challenge 2015.
